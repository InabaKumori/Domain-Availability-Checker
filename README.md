# Domain-Availability-Checker
This Python script efficiently checks the availability of domain names based on the specified top-level domain (TLD), length of the domain, and other criteria. It leverages the whois library to query domain registration details and determines if a domain is available, already registered, or soon to be available based on its expiration date.
